    "Returns the caller of the current contract context. If this contract is the first one called by a signed transaction, the caller will be equal to the signing principal. If <i>contract-call?</i> was used to invoke a function from a new contract, <i>contract-caller</i> changes to the <u>calling</u> contract&quot;s principal. If <i>as-contract</i> is used to change the <i>tx-sender</i> context, <i>contract-caller</i> <u>also</u> changes to the same contract principal."
