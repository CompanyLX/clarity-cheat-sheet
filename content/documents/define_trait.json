    "<i>define-trait</i> is used to define a new trait definition for use in a smart contract. Other contracts can implement a given trait and then have their contract identifier being passed as function arguments in order to be called dynamically with <i>contract-call?</i>.",
    "Traits are defined with a name, and a list functions defined with a name, a list of argument types, and return type.",
    "Like other kinds of definition statements, <i>define-trait</i> may only be used at the top level of a smart contract definition (i.e., you cannot put a define statement in the middle of a function body)."
