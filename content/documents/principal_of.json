    "The <i>principal-of?</i> function returns the principal derived from the provided public key. If the <i>public-key</i> is invalid, it will return the error code <i>(err u1).</i>.",
    "Note: Before Stacks 2.1, this function has a bug, in that the principal returned would always be a testnet single-signature principal, even if the function were run on the mainnet. Starting with Stacks 2.1, this bug is fixed, so that this function will return a principal suited to the network it is called on. In particular, if this is called on the mainnet, it will return a single-signature mainnet principal."
