    "<i>to-consensus-buff</i> is a special function that will serialize any Clarity value into a buffer, using the SIP-005 serialization of the Clarity value. Not all values can be serialized: some value&quot;s consensus serialization is too large to fit in a Clarity buffer (this is because of the type prefix in the consensus serialization).",
    "If the value cannot fit as serialized into the maximum buffer size, this returns <i>none</i>, otherwise, it will be <i>(some consensus-serialized-buffer)</i>. During type checking, the analyzed type of the result of this method will be the maximum possible consensus buffer length based on the inferred type of the supplied value."
