    "<i>impl-trait</i> can be use for asserting that a contract is fully implementing a given trait. Additional checks are being performed when the contract is being published, rejecting the deployment if the contract is violating the trait specification.",
    "Trait identifiers can either be using the sugared syntax (.token-a.token-trait), or be fully qualified (&quot;SPAXYA5XS51713FDTQ8H94EJ4V579CXMTRNBZKSF.token-a.token-trait).",
    "Like other kinds of definition statements, <i>impl-trait</i> may only be used at the top level of a smart contract definition (i.e., you cannot put such a statement in the middle of a function body)."
